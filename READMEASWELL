First off, don't forget that this repo will be gone by the end of this week, so make sure to clone or pull the latest commits so 
you have all the material.

Second of all, and I've said many times that I've said many times that I've already said it a few times that I really wish you all 
the best for your next challenges. I'm overwhelmed by the many little gestures, messages and expressions of gratitude and farewell. 
Never would I have thought, having started this journey of mine no more than 3 months ago, how valuable this experience would be 
for myself. My sincere gratitude goes to all of you for making the time we spent so much more than enjoyable. 
Enough said. For the thirteenth time.
Don't forget to come visit whenever you can and definitely do keep me updated on your next steps. 
Reach out whenever you need advice, career- or otherwise.
